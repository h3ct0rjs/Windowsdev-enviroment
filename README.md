# Windows Reading List 

[![Donate](https://s3.amazonaws.com/listjs/donate-coffee.png)](http://devops.com.co)

I was working with Gnu/Linux and Unix environments for daily sysops and dev work, it has been a worderful experience and a joy journey, during 
that time I tried to learn as much as I could. Knowing OS internals is going to give you a key advantage for solving problems. 
This repo will contain all the links that I'm using to understand the microsoft ecosystem, It will try to use Windows 7/10 as OS base. 

If you know any other recommendation for this reading, it will be my pleasure to read it and add it to my list. Create a fork and do a pull request to 
 in this repo.
